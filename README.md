This was an app prototype built for MilluBox. Using Swift and Xcode, this app is now used for them to pitch to VCs to show their possibility of having a digital presence.
The app seeks to design quality time between parents and children through discussions and activities. There can also be a forum feature where parents can talk about parenting struggles, successes, or find community.
